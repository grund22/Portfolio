# portfolio

  The past 12 weeks I completed a front end web development course through Code Louisville. I had the opportunity to create a website that I decided would be a resume for my talent. In the resume I outlined my experience, my credentials and what got me to where I am today. I also connected a couple of pages to my index page inlucding an about me, portfolio, and a contact form. I created my "JM" logo with a program called "Canva" and I used it to set the theme for the rest of the page.
  
  
  The first feature I decided to include in my website was from the CSS Features List. It was the Use Flexbox or CSS Grid to organize content areas based on mobile or desktop views. On a desktop view I had my columns and nav bar going horizontal, and then going to mobile view I had them decrease in size and go vertical.


The second feature I dedcided to include was a jss feature. I have it so that when you scroll over the "JM" logo, a alert then pops up that reads "Thank you for checking out my page."
 
 
  The third css feature that I am including is that I have a working navation bar on my home screen that will correctly navagate you to the Contact page, the About me page, and the Portfolio page. 
  
  
  The fourth javascript feautre is that I have a contact form, that upon sumbission will give you a "Thank you" alert.
